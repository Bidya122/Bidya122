# RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis (Hands-on Training at CATR)

This repository contains my hands-on RNA-seq analysis project, developed during a training session at CATR. The project follows a full RNA-seq pipeline—from raw FASTQ files to identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DESeq2 in R.

## 🧪 Pipeline Overview

1. **Quality Control** – FastQC  
2. **Trimming** – Trimmomatic  
3. **Alignment** – HISAT2  
4. **Read Counting** – featureCounts  
5. **Differential Expression Analysis** – DESeq2  
6. **Visualization** – Volcano plot, PCA plot, MA plot

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw and trimmed FASTQ files  
- `results/`: Alignment outputs, counts, and DESeq2 results  
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts and R code  
- `plots/`: Visualization outputs  
- `metadata/`: Sample sheet or design matrix

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Packages

- FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, featureCounts  
- R packages: DESeq2, ggplot2, EnhancedVolcano

---

## 📊 Key Outputs

- Table of DEGs (up/down-regulated genes)  
- Volcano plot highlighting significant DEGs  
- PCA plot showing sample clustering  
- MA plot

## 🎯 What I Learned

This project helped me apply core bioinformatics tools and understand the RNA-seq analysis process, especially using DESeq2 for statistical testing and visualization.
