# 🧬 RNAseqProjects

Welcome! This repository hosts my RNA-seq analysis projects built through hands-on learning and workshops. I have only selected small datasets to work with as I can only use WSL1. I have learned using larger datasets from the training workshops.

Each subfolder contains a complete pipeline—from raw data to visualization—using public datasets.

🛠️ Techniques covered include:
- Read trimming and QC
- Genome alignment
- Feature counting
- Transcript visualization in R

More RNA-seq case studies coming soon!
